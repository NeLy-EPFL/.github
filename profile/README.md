**We are reverse-engineering the fly, _Drosophila melanogaster_, to understand how animals leverage social information, learn about the world, and generate flexible motor behaviors.** We believe that our efforts will uncover general insights into biological intelligence and can inform the design of better artificial systems and robots.

Flies are ideal for this goal: they generate complex behaviors yet have a small nervous system and are genetically malleable. For our research, we develop and use a variety of approaches **including microscopy, machine learning, genetics, and computational modeling.** We are part of the [Brain Mind Institute](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv/bmi/) and [Institute of Bioengineering](https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/bioengineering/) in the [School of Life Sciences](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­.
